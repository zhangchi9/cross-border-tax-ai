# Cross-Border Tax Consultant

A minimal-yet-production-ready AI web application that acts as a cross-border tax consultant. The app uses conversational AI to gather information, ask clarifying questions, and provide structured tax guidance for international tax situations.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

This application provides general information only and is not legal or tax advice. Always consult a qualified tax professional for specific guidance on your tax situation.

## Features

#### Setup & Run
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cross-border-tax

# Setup environment (choose one):
# Windows Command Prompt:
setup.bat

# Windows PowerShell:
setup.ps1

# Unix/Linux/Mac:
make setup

# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY

# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# Or for development with hot reload
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

**Access the application:**

- **Development**: http://localhost:5173
- **API**: http://localhost:8000

#### Docker Commands

**Using Make (Unix/Linux/Mac):**
```bash
make help          # Show all available commands
make up            # Start in production mode
make dev           # Start in development mode
make down          # Stop the application
make logs          # Show logs
make clean         # Remove all containers and images
```

**Direct Docker Compose (All platforms):**
```bash
docker-compose up -d                           # Start production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up   # Start development
docker-compose down                            # Stop application
docker-compose logs -f                         # Show logs
docker-compose ps                              # Show status
```

### üîß Manual Setup (Alternative)

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Gemini API key (get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

#### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cross-border-tax
```

#### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY

# Run the server
python -m app.main
```

The backend will start at `http://localhost:8000`

#### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start at `http://localhost:5173`

#### 4. Open the Application

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to start using the tax consultant.

## Usage Flow

### 1. Intake Phase
The AI will gather basic information:
- Countries/jurisdictions involved
- Tax residency status
- Income sources
- Tax year
- Foreign assets
- Filing status

### 2. Clarifications Phase
The AI asks targeted follow-up questions based on your situation to understand:
- Specific cross-border issues
- Tax treaty implications
- Potential compliance requirements
- Risk factors

### 3. Final Suggestions
After sufficient information is gathered, the AI provides:
- **Key Issues**: Main tax considerations identified
- **Suggested Actions**: Recommended next steps
- **Documents to Gather**: Paperwork you'll likely need
- **Forms Involved**: Tax forms that may be required (marked as "likely")
- **Risks & Questions**: Areas requiring professional attention

### 4. Message Editing Feature
You can edit any of your previous messages to explore different scenarios:
- **Hover** over any of your messages to see the edit button (‚úèÔ∏è)
- **Click** the edit button to modify your response
- **Save** your changes to continue the conversation from that point
- All messages after the edited message will be removed
- The AI will respond based on the new conversation flow

## API Endpoints

- `POST /session/create` - Create new consultation session
- `GET /session/{id}` - Get session details
- `POST /chat` - Send message (streaming response)
- `POST /message/edit` - Edit a previous message (streaming response)
- `POST /session/{id}/force_final` - Request final suggestions

## Development

### üê≥ Docker Development (Recommended)

The easiest way to develop with hot reload and automatic restarts:

```bash
# Start development containers with hot reload
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# View logs (useful for debugging)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Stop development containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Restart containers (if needed after major changes)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart
```

**Development URLs:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (with hot reload)
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000 (with auto-reload)

**Development Features:**
- Frontend: Hot reload on file changes
- Backend: Auto-reload on Python file changes
- Volume mounting: Your code changes are immediately reflected
- Debug logging: Enhanced logging for development
